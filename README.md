book's library

The application works like a data base with readers and books. 
A costumer has access to several functions: show books, show a reader, enter a new book, enter a new reader, return a book, clear the display, etc. 
I used basics of OOP (hierarchy of classes) and STL for designing of the application.

Book's library with user's menu:
1) Show the library
2) Show books
3) Show a reader
4) Enter a new book
5) Enter a new reader
6) Search and give a book
7) Return a book
8) Delete a reader
9) Delete a book
10) Clear the display
11) Exit

In process of development.
